              <h3>Our resources</h3>
              <p>While tutoring certainly helps students stay on track academically, most of the hard work still has to be done by the students themselves.
<br />As the average student will only have a couple hours at most per week with their students, it is imperative that they keep their skills sharp.
<br />Luckily for you, we searched far and wide to provide quality practice tests, worksheets, and study materials! Our resources cover multiple
<br />different subjects and grade levels, so you are bound to find what you’re looking for and more!

<h3>Fun Educational Games</h3>
<p>As the old adage goes: “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.”  While it is vital for a student to put in the necessary effort, and receive
<br />help when needed, students cannot study all day every day, as they are not robots. However, even a student’s break time can still hold
<br />educational value! To help students across the globe retain their love for learning, we’ve devised a number of fun learning activities, which keep
<br />students active and away from their screens! <p>


              <h3>Math Games</h3>
              <p>One and One: This is based on a common term used in amateur basketball, in which the person shooting free throws faces the following situation: if the<br />player misses, the ball is live. Otherwise he/she gets another shot. We decided to apply this to our game as well, but instead of<br />shooting free throws, we’re doing math problems.<br /><br />For this exercise, you need a clean trash can and a crumpled paper ball. Place the can 15 feet from each competitor.  For each turn,<br />have the player solve a math-related problem. If he/she gets the problem correct, the player gets one point, and gets one chance to<br />shoot the paper ball into the trash can. The player must sit down in a criss cross stance,If he/she makes the shot, he gets one more<br />point. However, if the player gets the problem wrong, he/she gets zero points, and their turn is over. First to get 10(or any other number)<br />points is declared the winner!<br />For more exhilarating competitions like these, be sure to visit this link!<br /><a href="https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/15-math-games-15-minutes-or-less/">Math game we prepared for you</a></p>

              <h3>Vocabulary & Spelling Games</h3>
              <p>Modified Shiritori : Inspired by the traditional Japanese word game, Shiritori, each player must say a word that starts with the ending letter of the last
		          word. However, we’ve added some twists to this Japanese past time. Each person has 10-15 seconds to think of a word that starts<br />with the ending letter of the last word, and it has to be unique from the previous words. If the player fails to meet either of these<br />requirements, they would receive a strike. If a player gets 3 strikes, they are eliminated. The last man standing is the winner!<br />For more exciting activities like these, be sure to visit this link!<br /><a href="https://jimmyesl.com/esl-vocabulary-games/#:~:text=%2017%20Fun%20ESL%20Vocabulary%20Games%20to%20Teach,fun%20way%20to%20practise%20new%20vocabulary%21%20More%20

              <h3>Grammar Games</h3>
              <p>Squirt Gun Mania: Looking for a way to spice up grammar with a high-stakes yet kid-friendly game? Well this is the one for you!<br />For this game, you’d need one squirt gun.<br />For this exercise, have each competitor fix a sentence so that it becomes grammatically correct. For each error
		          a player gets, he/she gains one point, and gets shot with the water gun one time by the host. If the contestant gets
		          the sentence completely correct, he/she gets to shoot the host one time with the water gun! If a player gets 10
		          (or any number) points, they are eliminated! The last man standing is the winner!<br />For more engaging diversions like these, be sure to visit this link!<br /><a href="https://www.brighthubeducation.com/elementary-school-activities/114376-fun-grammar-games-for-your-students/#:~:text=%20Here%20are%20some%20of%20our%20favorites%3A%20,Gorillas%2C%E2%80%9D%20this%20game%20allows%20you%20to...%20More%20">Grammar activities</a></div></p>
